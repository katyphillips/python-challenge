# python-challenge
Repository for Module 3 Challenge
This repository contains 2 folders:
  PyBank contains budget analysis data that tracks profit and losses and changes in those profits and losses.
  PyPoll contains ection data analyzed to determine the winner of a local election.
The Resources folders contain the source csv code for each of the Python files.
The analysis folders contain the text output files for each of the source codes.
Adam Siens (TA) helped me set my initial values for my variables using the "next" command, and then helped me incorporate those in my for loop for my budget_data_analysis.py file.  Liz DiScala (classmate) helped me write the code to write to the text file.
